# Hangman-Game

WHO'S THAT POKEMON?! 

A Pokemon-themed hangman game, which takes the letters the user enters on the keyboard. Based on which Pokemon has been randomly generated, the program will store the incorrect letters in 'Letters Used' and correct guesses will fill in the appropriate blanks. Each round gives the user 10 incorrect guesses. The program also keeps track of the number of wins and the Pokemon successfully caught.
